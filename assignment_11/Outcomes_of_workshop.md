### Outcomes from the Workshop
- The first step was about the data exporting into the https://ce.ezanalytix.com/ platform, and it has very easy option to drag and drop which is very flexible and time saving.
- By creating a repeatable method, a scientific investigation can be moved from raw data to informative contribution with a single mouse click. To specify how data and processes interact and flow through business logic, use functional widgets on data.
- Users can simply establish data editing rules for various data types, including deterministic imputation rules, using the user-friendly interface. The system evaluates the data's accuracy and gives quality indicator information and indications. 
- The strong data editing rule engine automates the data editing process and saves time validating and cleaning data, allowing the user to focus entirely on data analysis.
- Missing data always present a challenge to data analytics. EzAnalytix provides a number of stochastic imputation algorithms for users to choose from in order to avoid bias and ensure the quality of their study.
- EzAnalytix allows users to employ a range of methods to evaluate a dataset using numerous models. By examining the outcomes of several models, users can discover mistakes by better understanding the interactions between data variables, features, and algorithms. The bias inherent in particular models may otherwise obscure the relationships.
- The resulting report contains detailed information to assist the user in interpreting the ML analysis and modeling results. For instance, the report could incorporate descriptive analysis, model fitting, and assumption testing, among other things.
